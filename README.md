# Digit-Classification
This is the first Deep Learning Model I have built. 

## Data
### I have prepared some images of digits from 0 to 9. You can find that at *data.zip*

## Model
### Model is based on PyTorch and has common layers: Convolution, Batch Normalization, Linear, Activation Layer.

## Weight
### Weight of model is saved at */weight/weights.ckpt*

## Result 
### The accuracy is definitely high because data is simple.
